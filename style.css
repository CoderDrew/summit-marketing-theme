Base Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------

This theme intentionally keeps CSS minimal.

• Global styles, colors, typography, and spacing are defined in theme.json
• Layout and structure are handled via block templates and patterns
• CSS is added here only when:
  - WordPress core does not provide the needed control
  - A small, targeted override is required
  - A component cannot be expressed cleanly via blocks alone

The goal is clarity and restraint — not cleverness.
